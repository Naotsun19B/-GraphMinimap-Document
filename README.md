## Description

This plugin adds a minimap to the graph editor that gives you an overview of the entire graph.  
You can also operate the graph editor from the minimap.  

## Requirement

Target version : UE4.24 ï½ž 5.2    
Target platform : Windows, Mac, Linux  

## Installation

Install from the [marketplace](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en/product/graph-minimap).  
If the feature is not available after installing the plugin, it is possible that the plugin has not been enabled, so please check if the plugin is enabled from Edit > Plugins.

## Features And Usages

It supports basic graph editors such as blueprint and material, etc.  
The minimap is automatically displayed when you open the graph editor.  
You can switch the minimap mode with the shortcut key.  
The default shortcut key is ```Ctrl + M```.  
The minimap mode and size are saved for each graph and will be restored the next time you open the graph editor.  

### Hidden

The minimap is hidden.  

### Resizable
