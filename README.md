The minimap is automatically displayed when you open the graph editor.  
You can switch the minimap mode with the shortcut key.  
The default shortcut key is ```Ctrl + M```.  
The minimap mode and size are saved for each graph and will be restored the next time you open the graph editor.  

### Hidden
